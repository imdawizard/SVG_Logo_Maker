## Installation
You will
1. Need node downloaded onto your machine.
2. Ensure that the inquirer package is also downloaded.
3. Need to open your terminal of choice for #usage.

## Usage
Run node index in your terminal of choice then answer the following questions: The text you want(only 3 letters), the color of the text, pick between a circle, triangle and a square, then finally the color of the shape.

## License
This project does not currently have a license.

## Features
Some of the many features of this program include:
- An if statement for users who enter in more than 3 characters during the first prompt
- A cleverly designed system on index.js that uses less code when calling the differnet shapes, due to the fact that they have different point systems

## Contribution Guidelines
This is a private project for instructional purposes. Future contributions are unlikely but possible.

## Tests
Pre-made jest tests were conducted for more structural code, these tests test that when colors are applied to the shapes, that they do indeed work.
